### $whoami :turtle:

My name is Tom√°≈° and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mathematical Computer Science at [Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering CUT](https://www.fjfi.cvut.cz/en/), further focusing on theory of probability and the field of cybersecurity.

Besides computer science and mathematics, I'm an avid reader interested in philosophy and linguistics and a gamer.

Also a fl√¢neur, a hacker, an autodidact and an anarchist.

I mostly use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/).
