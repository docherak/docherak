### $whoami :turtle:

My name is Tom√°≈° and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Mathematical Computer Science at [Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering CUT](https://www.fjfi.cvut.cz/en/), further focusing on theory of probability and the field of cybersecurity.

Besides computer science and mathematics, I'm an avid reader interested in philosophy and linguistics and a gamer.

Also a fl√¢neur, a hacker and an anarchist.

I mostly use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/).
Currently experimenting with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix) (a neovim inspired editor, written in Rust).

My long-term goal is to master Rust[currently], Haskell[to-do] and Julia[to-do].

**currently:**
- re-learning webdev via [The Odin Project](theodinproject.com/) (Ruby path)
- learning C/C++ at uni
- doing some shell scripting and Python automation when bored
- studying for exams
- exploring gamedev in ~~Unity~~ Godot
- learning Java, Rust
- learning Dvorak keyboard layout
