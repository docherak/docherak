### $whoami :turtle:

A fl√¢neur, a hacker and an anarchist.

I mostly use [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [Atom](https://atom.io/).
Currently experimenting with [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).

**currently:**
- re-learning webdev via [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/) (Ruby path)
- learning C/C++
- doing some shell scripting and Python automation when bored
- exploring gamedev in ~~Unity~~ Godot
- learning Java, Rust
- learning Dvorak keyboard layout
- learning hacking at [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)
